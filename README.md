# Parsely - A Parsely RPG Client in Perl!

This implements the pen-and-paper RPG game [Parsely](http://www.memento-mori.com/parsely/) 
in Perl.

This is created for illustration purposes only, and should not be used to 
circumvent actually purchasing the game. If you intend to play one of those
adventures in this client, you should probably purchase a PDF of the game.
It's only $5 - you won't be disappointed!

This was inspired by a recent string of meetings of Madison Perl Mongers and 
JT Smith. Thanks for the idea!
